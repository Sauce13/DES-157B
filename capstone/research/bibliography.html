          The website is a detailed description and analysis of the Davis
          Centennial Seal, which was installed in 2021 to commemorate the 100th
          anniversary of Davis city's incorporation. The seal, designed by local
          artist Susan Shelton, represents the history, culture, and aspirations
          of Davis city through a complex array of imagery and symbolism. The
          source is extremely valuable for anyone wishing to understand the deep
          symbolism behind the seal, as it breaks down each component of the
          seal's design in a methodical manner. The author concludes that the
          seal is not just a historical representation, but a symbol of
          community, leadership, innovation, and more. This detailed explanation
          of the seal can provide a deeper appreciation of its intricate
          symbolism and the story of Davis city.

          This article discusses the installation of the Davis Centennial Seal.
          This source was extremely useful for understanding the background,
          funding, and community involvement in the project. The author
          concludes by highlighting the significant contributions of local
          residents and donors to the project, and the potential of the seal as
          a gathering and educational space. My conclusion aligns with the
          author's, as I find the story of community collaboration and
          engagement in creating this emblematic piece to be a testament to the
          spirit of Davis.

        <p>
          This source describes the symbolic meaning of the outer ring of the
          Davis Centennial Seal, focusing on the depiction of Putah Creek's
          native flora and fauna. The narrative underscores the historical
          significance of the creek, its decline due to human alteration, and
          its revival due to citizen-led conservation efforts. This source is
          useful for understanding the underlying meanings and symbolism in the
          seal's design. The author concludes by linking the creek's restoration
          with the ideals of cooperation, engagement, vision, and leadership. I
          concur with this conclusion, recognizing the seal as a profound
          tribute to the community's shared values and environmental
          stewardship.
