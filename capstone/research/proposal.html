    <h1>Proposal</h1>
    <p>
        My topic is an interactive map of the seal with the
        possibility of adding a "wheres waldo" type of game to it time permitting.
        I want to create a high quality map of the seal so it can be acessed anywhere and not just in person. My target audience would be anyone
        that heard of the seal maybe inclass or elsewhere. If they didn't have time to go look at it the seal in person they could open up my website to take a look.
        It would make lessons around the seal alot more accessible if it was available on the internet.
        The map would function like google maps with bieng able to drag the map to look at different areas. Also the
        ability to zoom in and zoom out for wider views. I am a little concerned about getting the images to create the map since
        im not sure I have the proper equipment. I've also never really stiched iamges together to make a map so I am a little worried that
        it might take a while to do that.
